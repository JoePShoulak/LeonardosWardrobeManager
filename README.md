Hello!

This is my first add-on, and very much in beta. I plan on adding many fun and exciting features in the next few weeks.

This add-on currently allows for selecting an outfit to be switched to instantly upon entering Combat or Stealth,
and back to your default outfit (or stealth if you leave combat while crouched) afterward.
I plan on adding many more cases of what can trigger an outfit change, like being in a dungeon, PVP, a specific zone,
or even which ability bar you're using.

Dependencies:
Just [LibAddonMenu2](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu.html)!

Please try it out, and please give me feedback! This mod is for you, so let me know what you want.

Issues can be submitted here, or on [ESO UI](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3180-LeonardosWardrobeManager.html).
